# Overview

This repository stores supplementary datasets made available for QS case study assignment. The information contained in these datasets may be:

1. based on information that is publicly available but not already consolidate in readily usable form elsewhere, & we considered it unreasonable to expect candidates to consolidate it themselves under time-sensitive conditions; or
2. simulated for the purpose of the case study.

Either way, there is nothing sensitive here, hence why we are hosting it publicly. That said, we make no claims to the veracity of the datasets contained in this repo, and will not take responsilibity for any inference drawn from them beyond the intended use case.

# Current files

1. `btomapping.csv`: list of all BTO projects with expected completion date from year 2018 onwards to date, with region / planning area / subzone information (based on Master Plan 2019), estimated year of completion, and total number of units for each project. Note: some projects had multiple rows, based on different completion years (e.g. for Punggol Point Cove, 1 set of 1172 units are expected to be completed in 2023, and another 1179 are expected to be completed in 2024). Refer to commit messages for the latest BTO launch period covered.
