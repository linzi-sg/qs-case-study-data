# qs-case-study-data

This repository stores supplementary datasets made available for QS case study assignment. The information contained in these datasets may be:

1. based on information that is publicly available but not already consolidate in readily usable form elsewhere, & we considered it unreasonable to expect candidates to consolidate it themselves under time-sensitive conditions; or
2. simulated for the purpose of the case study.

Either way, there is nothing sensitive here, hence why we are hosting it publicly. That said, we make no claims to the veracity of the datasets contained in this repo, and will not take responsilibity for any inference drawn from them beyond the intended use case.
